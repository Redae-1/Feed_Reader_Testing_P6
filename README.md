Download the project and you get all the unit testing performed on the Udacity web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

1. Test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.

2. Test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.

3. Write a new test suite named "The menu".

4. A test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default.

5. A test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.

6. Write a new test suite named "Initial Entries".

7. A test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container. 

8. Write a new test suite named "New Feed Selection".

9. A test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes. loadFeed() is asynchronous.

When you run the index.html file Jasmin appear on the bottom of the browser and all(Seven) Spec bar get green that is all of the tests pass.
